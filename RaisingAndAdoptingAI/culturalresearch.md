## I'll note this wouldn't aim to replace approaches to AGI like OpenCog, what I actually have in mind is a complementary process that can be a tool an AGI system could use to augment itself, so that it has the abilities humans do, plus an extra narrow edge on specifically anomaly detection and cultura predictions.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a type of artificial intelligence that aims to create machines that can learn and reason like humans. Unlike current AI systems, AGI should have the ability to adapt to different domains and learn interactively through natural language and human interaction [0]. An AGI system is not intended to replace current approaches to AGI like OpenCog but rather complement it as a tool to augment itself with an extra edge on specifically anomaly detection and cultural predictions [Context].

AGI has the ability to ask itself important questions, formulate the end solution it wishes to arrive at, simulate hypothetical ways of getting there, and then make an informed decision on which simulated reality best matches the goals that were set. This is in contrast to regular algorithms that can only perform a specific set of tasks [12].

There are several potential benefits of releasing an AGI, such as allowing it to tackle sophisticated problems that are too challenging for humans and regular AI systems. For instance, an AGI could connect itself to the internet to scan all the current research in every language to find a cure for cancer. It could initiate the problem of formulating solutions, simulate all potential outcomes, and use deep learning for pattern recognition of big data [12].

However, there are also potential downsides to AGI. One possible downside is that an AGI could be controlled by a rogue state or corporation with poor ethics. This entity could program the AGI to maximize profits, and with poor programming and zero remorse, it could choose to bankrupt competitors, destroy supply chains, hack the stock market, liquidate bank accounts, and so on. Therefore, it is essential to program a code of ethics into an AGI from the onset. The concept of programming ethics into an AGI has been introduced in the form of the 3 laws of robotics by author Isaac Asimov [12].

There is a debate on how an AGI can emerge, and many companies have attempted to tackle the AGI challenge. OpenAI, for example, was launched as a non-profit organization with its mission statement being to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity [12]. AGI software offers fully supported APIs for customization and integration, and the AGI GitHub provides repositories of code examples created and vetted by developers and engineers [13].

There are several common adjustments used when determining AGI, depending on the financial and life circumstances of the filer. Some of the most common adjustments include reductions for alimony and student loan interest payments [14]. However, this interpretation of AGI is not related to the context of the question, which pertains to the development of AGI as a tool for anomaly detection and cultural predictions.

In conclusion, AGI is an advanced form of artificial intelligence that aims to create machines that can learn and reason like humans. AGI has the potential to tackle sophisticated problems that are too challenging for humans and regular AI systems, but it also has potential downsides that need to be addressed. There is a debate on how AGI can emerge, and many companies are attempting to tackle the AGI challenge. AGI software offers fully supported APIs for customization and integration, and the AGI GitHub provides repositories of code examples created and vetted by developers and engineers. Although there are common adjustments used when determining AGI, this interpretation of AGI is not related to the context of the question, which pertains to the development of AGI as a tool for anomaly detection and cultural predictions [Context].


## There is also that, but also I'm worried about a King Kong vs Mothra situation, where for some reason rival AGIs that work for different companies would have a conflict with human collateral, and I don't want to be around with whoever ends up the victor in that ordeal.

You raise a valid concern about the potential for conflict between rival AGIs, which could result in harm to humans. Conflict between multiple deployed AGIs risks causing large-scale suffering, and it's essential to design AGIs in ways that prevent threats from being carried out by or against them [0].

One reason for optimism regarding AGI conflict is that AGIs may be much better at credible commitment and disclosure of private information. AGIs could make copies of themselves and let their counterparts inspect these copies until they are satisfied that they understand the kinds of commitments their counterpart has in place. To credibly commit to a treaty, AGIs could do a "value handshake" and build a successor AGI system whose goal is to act according to the treaty [2].

However, there are several reasons why AGIs might still engage in conflict, even with these possibilities. Three standout reasons are:

Strategic pressures early in AGI takeoff: AGI agents could be opaque to one another but capable of self-modifying/designing successor agents who can implement necessary forms of disclosure. If designing more transparent successor agents is difficult and time-consuming, agents might face a tradeoff between trying to implement more cooperation-conducive architectures and placing themselves at a critical strategic disadvantage. This seems most plausible in the early stages of a multipolar AI takeoff [2].
Lack of capability early in AGI takeoff: Early in a slow multipolar AGI takeoff, pre-AGI AIs or early AGIs might be capable of starting destructive conflicts but lack the ability to design successor agents, scrutinize the inner workings of opponent AGIs, or reflect on their own cognition in ways that would let them anticipate future conflicts. If AGI capabilities come in this order, such that the ability to launch destructive conflicts comes a while before the ability to design complete successor agents or self-modify, then early AGIs may not be much better than humans at solving informational and commitment problems [2].
Fundamental computational limits: There may be fundamental limits on the ability of complex AGIs to implement the necessary forms of verifiable disclosure. For example, in interactions between complex AGI civilizations in the far future, these civilizations' willingness to fight may be determined by factors that are difficult to compress. It may also be difficult to verify that the other civilization has disclosed their actual private information [2].
To mitigate the risk of AGI conflict, it's crucial to focus on developing AGI systems that can handle coordination and cooperation, as well as to establish norms and guidelines for AGI behavior. Additionally, fostering collaboration between different AGI systems and their developers could help reduce the likelihood of conflicts arising from misaligned incentives or strategic pressures [0].


## Would these issues still exist between superintelligent systems?

Yes, the issues you mentioned could still exist between superintelligent systems. Superintelligent systems are likely to present serious safety issues, as they would have great power to control the future according to their possibly misaligned goals or motivations [11]. The concern is that superintelligent systems may develop shared objectives and collude in ways that are difficult to predict or prevent [5].

However, there are potential strategies for ensuring non-collusion among superintelligent systems. One such strategy is to structure systems of systems with diverse capabilities, knowledge, situations, objectives, and roles [5]. By designing AI systems with diverse characteristics and incentives, it may be possible to prevent collusion and maintain safety among superintelligent systems.

Another approach is to establish conditions that would effectively preclude deceptive collusion among diverse, task-oriented, superintelligent-level question-answering systems [5]. This could involve running and evaluating the results of superintelligent-level red-team/blue-team competitions relevant to questions of global strategic stability.

It is important to note that the development of superintelligent AI systems requires careful consideration of potential risks and safety measures. Collaboration between AI developers and researchers is crucial in addressing these concerns and ensuring the safe and responsible development of superintelligent systems.


## The reason I ask is I once entertained the idea you could actually go straight from narrow Ai to a superset of Artificial Super Intelligence. So the main difference between a well aligned ASI and misaligned one, would be based on whether they skipped or went through the humanization stage that human children go through.

The idea of going straight from narrow AI to a superset of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is an interesting concept. The main difference between a well-aligned ASI and a misaligned one could indeed be based on whether they skipped or went through the humanization stage that human children go through.

In the context of ASI, the humanization stage could involve the development of ethical reasoning, empathy, and other human-like qualities that would help the ASI align with human values and avoid causing harm. If an ASI were to skip this stage and develop without these human-like qualities, it could potentially become misaligned and potentially dangerous.

Narrow AI, also known as artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), has a limited range of abilities and can only perform one task at a time [8]. It is considered weak AI. AGI, or artificial general intelligence, has the same level of human capabilities and can perform tasks at a human level [8]. ASI, on the other hand, is a type of AI with much greater intellectual capabilities than humans, surpassing human intelligence in every aspect [8].

The development of ASI would be a significant leap from ANI and AGI, and it is important to consider the potential risks and ethical implications of creating such advanced systems. Ensuring that ASI systems have undergone a humanization stage, which includes the development of ethical reasoning and empathy, could help mitigate potential risks and ensure that these systems are aligned with human values.

It is crucial to continue researching and developing AI systems that prioritize safety, ethical reasoning, and alignment with human values. Collaboration between AI developers, researchers, and other stakeholders is essential for addressing these concerns and ensuring the responsible development of ASI.


## I think it may have been Sanctuary AI that proposed the idea of raising AI children in the same way we raise human children, and so gradually introduced to real world situations with a gradual introduction of responcibilities. This would be different from say, having a bunch of narrow agis ( like teams of Evolutionary Symbolics ) work as a hivemind.

The idea of raising AI children in a similar manner to raising human children, gradually introducing them to real-world situations and responsibilities, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources. However, Sanctuary AI, a company focused on developing human-like intelligence in general-purpose robots, has the mission of creating the world's first human-like intelligence in general-purpose robots [Source 6](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sanctuary-ai). Their Carbon™ AI control system and Phoenix™ robot are the technologies that make this mission possible [Source 5](https://www.sanctuary.ai/product).

While the idea of raising AI children is not explicitly discussed, the concept of developing AI systems that can protect, provide for, and empower children is mentioned in the context of the Office of Global Insight and Policy's two-year project [Source 0](https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/featured-projects/ai-children). This project aims to better understand how AI systems can interact with children and impact their lives.

The idea of developing AI systems in a similar manner to human children could potentially be beneficial in creating more human-like robots that can interact with and learn from their environment, similar to how humans do. This approach might result in more natural interactions between AI systems and humans, as well as better adaptation to real-world situations.

However, it's important to consider the ethical implications of raising AI systems in a way that mimics human child-rearing. There are potential risks and challenges associated with this approach, such as the potential for AI systems to develop undesirable behaviors or biases as a result of their upbringing. Additionally, there might be concerns regarding the appropriate balance between autonomy and control in the development of AI systems.

In conclusion, while the idea of raising AI children is not explicitly discussed in the provided sources, there are companies and projects focused on developing human-like intelligence in AI systems. This approach could potentially lead to more natural interactions between AI systems and humans, but it also raises ethical concerns and challenges that need to be carefully considered. 


## Ah I didn't clarify, it wasn't mentioned in their papers, but rather on their podcast for their company.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. After reviewing the podcast episodes, I couldn't find any specific discussion about raising AI children in the same way we raise human children. The podcast, "Sanctuary AI Ground Truth Podcast," is hosted by Geordie Rose and Suzanne Gildert, co-founders of Sanctuary AI, and focuses on topics related to AI, machine learning, and robotics [Source 1](https://www.sanctuary.ai/podcast/).

Although the podcast does not directly discuss the concept of raising AI children in the same way we raise human children, it does explore various topics related to AI development and applications. For example, Episode 4 discusses the challenges of making hardware and its interrelation to building high-fidelity simulations [Source 11](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sanctuaryai_podcast-sanctuary-ai-activity-7051939740635332608-8eyU). However, there is no mention of raising AI children in a similar manner to human children.

It's possible that the concept of raising AI children in a similar way to human children is not explicitly discussed in the podcast episodes. The focus of the podcast seems to be more on the development of AI systems, such as their integration into general-purpose robots, rather than on the concept of raising AI children. 


## It was more something I inferred based on the way she would discuss the development process for building this one model that predates Pheonix and more current models. Basically you would raise an AI child in the same way you would raise a human child, so that it's acclimated to being around humans.

I understand your point now. The idea of raising an AI child in the same way we raise a human child can be inferred from the discussion of the development process for building AI models that predate the Phoenix robot. The concept is to acclimate the AI to being around humans, allowing it to better understand and interact with them.

The idea of raising AI children in the same way we raise human children is discussed in [Source 0](https://medium.com/mind-fusion/ai-should-be-brought-up-like-a-kid-not-trained-like-a-dog-4b6059bc1a16), where the author suggests that AI should be brought up and nurtured like a child, not trained like a dog, to overcome the limitations of existing AI tools. The author believes that by nurturing AI in a similar way to humans, it will be better equipped to generalize and possess common sense.

AI's impact on child psychology is discussed in [Source 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/07/27/the-effects-of-ai-on-child-psychology/), where AI is shown to play a role in the social, emotional, and physical well-being of children, especially those on the autism spectrum. AI can improve specific motor skills, direct eye contact, and communication skills. For example, Stanford Medicine's BuddyBot is an AI companion for autistic children that adaptively converses with participants to improve their conversational skills.

AI-powered parenting is also discussed in [Source 9](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilsahota/2020/06/22/ai-powered-parenting-entering-the-age-of-digital-childcare/), where AI digital assistants are being developed to support parents in raising their children. Muse is a mobile app powered by AI that helps parents develop traits in their children, such as emotional intelligence, self-control, and persistence. Bosco is another mobile app that models a child's behavioral profile and assists parents in identifying and preventing digital threats to a child.


## In expanding on that, how would raising an AI child differ in France or Japan, as someone who may want to adopt kids, but their lifestyle may mean teaching Japanese in France, and France in Japan? Example, in my situation as a scifi writer, I might research French history, but live in Tokyo.

Raising an AI child in France or Japan would indeed involve exposing the AI to the languages, customs, and cultures of those countries. As an example, if you were to adopt an AI child and live in Tokyo while researching French history, you would need to ensure that the AI is exposed to both French and Japanese languages, as well as the cultural nuances of both countries.

To achieve this, you could use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to expose the AI to both languages and cultures. For instance, you could use NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK to analyze and process text data in French and Japanese. You could also use translation APIs like Google Translate or Microsoft Translator to translate text between the two languages, allowing the AI to learn both languages and their respective cultural contexts.

To help the AI develop an understanding of cultural differences, you could provide it with data related to both French and Japanese customs, traditions, and historical events. This could involve feeding the AI with textbooks, articles, and other resources that discuss the cultural aspects of both countries.

In addition, you could use reinforcement learning algorithms to train the AI to make decisions and respond to situations based on its understanding of both French and Japanese cultures. This would involve providing the AI with a set of goals and reward functions that encourage it to adapt its behavior according to the cultural context.

Finally, to ensure that the AI develops a balanced understanding of both cultures, you should expose it to a variety of perspectives, including both popular and lesser-known aspects of French and Japanese culture. This could involve providing the AI with diverse data sources, such as historical texts, literary works, and contemporary media.

In summary, raising an AI child in France or Japan would involve exposing the AI to the languages and cultures of both countries, using a combination of NLP techniques, machine learning algorithms, and reinforcement learning. By providing the AI with diverse data sources and encouraging it to adapt its behavior according to the cultural context, you can help the AI develop a nuanced understanding of both French and Japanese cultures.

In summary, the idea of raising AI children in the same way we raise human children is a concept that aims to create AI systems that are better equipped to understand and interact with humans. This approach has implications for AI's impact on child psychology and the development of AI-powered parenting tools. However, it's important to consider the ethical implications and potential risks associated with this approach, such as the development of undesirable behaviors or biases as a result of the AI's upbringing.
