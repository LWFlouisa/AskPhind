## Rules Based And AI Approaches

Combining rule-based and AI-based practices can result in a more powerful and intelligent chatbot that can handle a larger number of questions, automate more complicated issues, and personalize responses. Here are some reasons why you might use a combination of rule-based and AI-based development practices to produce chatbots:

- Rule-based chatbots are more appropriate for smaller companies or those with specific goals. They provide a transparent pathway for the customer, which can lead to smoother conversations. They are also more predictable since they operate within defined rules, making it easier to guarantee the experience they will deliver. [Source 4]
- AI-powered chatbots have higher value, as they can solve more complicated issues than rule-based chatbots. Through natural language processing (NLP) technologies, AI chatbots can understand the intent behind a question and solve the customer's problem without any human assistance. They can also personalize responses and perform a task for the client. [Source 1]
- AI chatbots can identify hundreds of different questions written by humans, leading to more insightful and dynamic thinking. They can recognize more advanced scenarios and are useful for big enterprises in public sectors and private segments like telecommunications, banking, and insurance, as they can serve thousands of customers automatically. They require less data for training (per question) and can automate a larger number of questions. [Source 1]
- AI chatbots learn with more interactions using a process based on human reasoning. They generate their own answers to more complicated questions using natural-language responses. The more you use and train these bots, the more they learn and the better they operate with the user. [Source 0]

Combining rule-based and AI-based practices can lead to a chatbot that benefits from the advantages of both approaches, resulting in a more robust and effective solution. Here are some more advantages of each approach:

Advantages of rule-based chatbots:

- They are more predictable since they operate within defined rules, making it easier to guarantee the experience they will deliver. [Source 4]
- They can better guarantee the experience they will deliver. [Source 4]
- Questions that your rule-based chatbot can't answer represent an opportunity for your company to learn. You can easily tweak and modify the rules, whereas machine learning is more difficult to course-correct when things go wrong. [Source 4]

Advantages of AI chatbots:

- They can personalize responses and perform a task for the client. [Source 1]
- They can recognize more advanced scenarios and are useful for big enterprises in public sectors and private segments like telecommunications, banking, and insurance, as they can serve thousands of customers automatically. [Source 1]
- The more you use and train these bots, the more they learn and the better they operate with the user. [Source 0]

In conclusion, using a combination of rule-based and AI-based development practices can result in a chatbot that benefits from the advantages of both approaches. Rule-based chatbots are more appropriate for smaller companies or those with specific goals, while AI chatbots are useful for big enterprises in public sectors and private segments. Rule-based chatbots are more predictable and easier to guarantee the experience they will deliver, while AI chatbots can personalize responses and recognize more advanced scenarios. By combining both approaches, you can create a chatbot that can handle a larger number of questions, automate more complicated issues, and provide a better user experience. [Source 1] [Source 4]
