## Benefits Of Using XML As An Intermediary
When developing chatbots, using XML-based markup languages as an intermediary between Ruby can provide several benefits. Here are some of them:

XML is a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data via the public internet, as well as via corporate networks.<br />
XML lets you define and store data in a shareable manner. XML supports information exchange between computer systems such as websites, databases, and third-party applications.<br />
XML can work behind the scene to simplify the creation of HTML documents for large web sites.<br />
XML can be used to exchange information between organizations and systems.<br />
XML can be used to store and arrange the data, which can customize your data handling needs.<br />
Virtually, any type of data can be expressed as an XML document.<br />
Using XML-based markup languages can also help when it comes to the following:

Parsing and processing data: XML can be easily parsed and processed by different programming languages and platforms, making it a great choice for data exchange in chatbot development.<br />
Defining custom tags: With XML, you can create your own self-descriptive tags or language that suits your application, making it easier to organize and structure your data.<br />
Sharing structured information: XML's primary function is to provide a "simple text-based format for representing structured information," according to the World Wide Web Consortium. This makes it a great choice for sharing structured data between different systems and applications.<br />
Overall, using XML-based markup languages can provide chatbot developers with a flexible, standardized, and easy-to-parse format for exchanging structured data between different systems and platforms.
