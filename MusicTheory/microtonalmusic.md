## My Prompt
So why is Hypolocrian often considered a theoretical Plagal mode? I know Hypophrygian notes often overlaps with B Locrian.

## Phind Says
The Hypolocrian mode is an almost entirely theoretical mode, introduced into chant theory in the 19th century by the editors of the Pustet-Ratisbon, Mechlin, and Rheims-Cambrai Office-Books, who designated it mode 12. It is the plagal counterpart to the authentic Locrian mode, mode 11 in that system of numbering [0]. The Hypolocrian mode is almost identical to the Locrian mode, but with a different final note. The final note of the Hypolocrian mode is B, just like the Locrian mode, but the ambitus of the mode lies between F and the F an octave higher, divided at the final, B. Its reciting tone (or tenor), is E, and its mediant is D. It has two participants, G and C [0].

The Hypolocrian mode is considered a plagal counterpart to the authentic Locrian mode. The plagal mode on A already had a long tradition as the Hypodorian, but its final was D. The two ecclesiastical modes called Locrian and Hypolocrian, each outfitted with a complete array of modal attributes, are an amalgam of past precedent and Rockstroâ€™s original invention [2]. The Hypolocrian mode is almost entirely theoretical, and although a few plainchant melodies, as well as polyphonic compositions, have been attributed to this mode by some writers, they are generally derived, by transposition, from some other tonality [0].

While the Hypophrygian mode shares some notes with the B Locrian mode, the two modes are not identical. The Hypophrygian mode is the plagal version of the Phrygian mode, and its final note is A [3].

## My Second Prompt
Are there musical modes and scales that are somewhere between the darker Phrygian modes and the lighter Locrian modes? In my play style, often in order to achieve that I have to play Pentatonically.

## Phind Says
Yes, there are musical modes and scales that fall between the darker Phrygian modes and the lighter Locrian modes. The seven modes, including the Phrygian and Locrian, can be thought of as a spectrum from dark to light [0]. The Phrygian mode is one of the darkest sounding modes, with many notes flattened, while the Locrian mode is very dark and minor, with incomplete melodies [3].

If you are looking for a scale somewhere between the Phrygian and Locrian modes, the Dorian mode may be a good choice. The Dorian mode is a minor mode that has a raised sixth scale degree, giving it a brighter sound than the Phrygian mode. The Dorian mode is also similar to the Aeolian mode, but with a raised sixth scale degree, making it brighter than the Aeolian mode, which is purely minor [3]. Another option is the Hypophrygian mode, which shares some notes with the B Locrian mode, but has a different final note, A [3].

Playing pentatonically is also a valid approach to achieve a sound between the Phrygian and Locrian modes. The pentatonic scale is a five-note scale that is widely used in a variety of musical genres. The minor pentatonic scale is a good choice for achieving a darker sound, and the blues scale, which adds a blue note to the pentatonic scale, can be used to add more color to the sound [14].


## My Third Prompt
How would you achieve something like Phrygian Diminished?

## Phind Says
To achieve the Phrygian Diminished sound, you can use the altered scale, which is the seventh mode of the melodic minor scale. The altered scale is also known as the Super Locrian scale, which is a mode of the melodic minor scale. The altered scale has a major third and a diminished fifth, which gives it a dark and mysterious sound [13].

To build the Phrygian mode, you can use the intervals of a minor second, a minor third, a perfect fourth, a perfect fifth, a minor sixth, and a minor seventh. The Phrygian mode is identical to the Aeolian mode, which is the natural minor scale, but with a flattened second scale degree. The flat-two note is what gives the Phrygian mode its distinct sound, which is dark and mysterious. Going from the tonic to the flat-two is immediately gives your music a dark and menacing sound [14].

The Phrygian Dominant mode is the closest relative to the standard Phrygian mode, and it is the same scale, but with a major third instead of a minor third. This creates an augmented second between the minor second and major third of the scale, which is associated with the harmonic minor scale. This interval gives the scale a decidedly "evil" and suspicious sound when played, which works well for film music [0].

In terms of chords, having a flattened second note makes a huge difference in tone and in the chords available to you. In A Phrygian, for example, we have access to Bb major, whereas in A minor, the chord built on the second scale degree is B diminished. Many songs written in Phrygian use the i-bII-i progression, which is the minor tonic to flat-major second progression.


## My Fourth Prompt
Ah I recognize this one. I've used it to make a variation of Pentatonic Sakura. Where the G above is sharpened slightly.

## Phind Says
It's great that you have used the altered scale to make a variation of the Pentatonic Sakura. As mentioned earlier, the altered scale is the seventh mode of the melodic minor scale, and it has a major third and a diminished fifth, giving it a dark and mysterious sound. The Phrygian mode, on the other hand, is built with the intervals of a minor second, a minor third, a perfect fourth, a perfect fifth, a minor sixth, and a minor seventh, and it is identical to the Aeolian mode, but with a flattened second scale degree.

To achieve the Phrygian Diminished sound, you can try using the Phrygian Dominant scale, which is the same as the Phrygian mode, but with a major third instead of a minor third. This creates an augmented second between the minor second and major third of the scale, which is associated with the harmonic minor scale. This interval gives the scale a decidedly "evil" and suspicious sound when played, which works well for film music [0]. You can experiment with this scale and try out different chord progressions to see what works best for your desired sound.


## My Fifth Prompt
What are the main differences between French classical music, and Japanese music of the same period. And how would you combine them?

## Phind Says
French classical music and Japanese music of the same period have some similarities and differences. French classical music began with the sacred music of the Roman Catholic Church and includes all the major genres of sacred and secular, instrumental and vocal music. French classical styles often have a national character [0]. On the other hand, Japanese music also has a long and storied history dating back centuries, with different types of music having emerged over the centuries. From traditional Japanese court music to Western-influenced classical music, there is a rich variety of classical music to be found in Japan. Western classical music has long been popular in Japan, and it encompasses a wide range of styles and genres, from the Renaissance to the present day. Western classical music actually has a significant presence in Japan, and it is performed and enjoyed by people of all ages in Japan [12].

One of the main differences between French classical music and Japanese music is the influence of religion. French classical music began with the sacred music of the Roman Catholic Church, whereas Japanese music was heavily influenced by the music of religious organizations, particularly Buddhism. Another significant difference is the general length and beginning of each history. Both traditions were equally influenced by the theories of a foreign culture from over the nearest sea: Greece for Italy and China for Japan. However, in the Japanese case, the foreign tradition of China at the time of its first major influence was alive and strong and could apply practical musical information and instrumentations as well as theories, whereas the Greek tradition was long dead by the same period when European monks turned to it for guidance [1].

Combining French classical music and Japanese music can be done in several ways. One way is to use traditional Japanese instruments in French classical music pieces. For example, the piece "Sakura" by Yuquijiro Yocoh is a popular piece played on the guitar, but it has a distinctly Japanese sound. Another way is to use French classical music elements in Japanese music pieces. For example, Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu was heavily influenced by French music, and his works often combine Western and Japanese elements. His piece "Requiem for Strings" is a good example of this. In this piece, Takemitsu combines Western string orchestra with Japanese percussion instruments, creating a unique and haunting sound [12]. Combining different musical styles can lead to a unique and interesting sound, and it is up to the creativity of the musician to experiment with different combinations.


## My Sixth Prompt
I was considering French instruments to play Japanese melodies. Also I'm finding scant information about Gagaku in particular, which I've wanting to blend with the Church modes in western music.

## Phind Says
French classical instruments such as the harpsichord, flute, and horn can be used to play Japanese melodies. However, since French classical music is based on different scales than traditional Japanese music, the melodies may need to be transposed or rearranged to fit the new scale. For example, if you wanted to use the Phrygian mode in French classical music to play a traditional Japanese melody, you would need to transpose the melody to fit the new scale. It is also possible to use traditional Japanese instruments such as the hichiriki, ryuteki, and sho to play French classical music pieces. However, it is important to note that these instruments have a different timbre and tuning than Western instruments, so they may need to be adapted to fit the Western scale [2].

Gagaku is a form of Japanese classical music that has been around for centuries and is characterized by its use of traditional Japanese instruments such as the hichiriki, ryuteki, and sho. Gagaku is often used in religious ceremonies and classical dance performances called bugaku, and it has been recognized as an important National Treasure in Japan. Gagaku has a distinct sound that is based on intonations at odds with the Western chromatic scale, and it is conceived with instruments that are unfamiliar to many. If you were to combine Gagaku with Church modes in Western music, it would require a careful consideration of the differences in scales and tuning, but it could lead to a unique and interesting sound. There are contemporary musicians who have drawn strongly on the traditions of Gagaku in their individual work, and have been able to build a bridge across the void separating what was from what could be [13].


## My Seventh Prompt
My approach had been to take Pentatonic Sakura, but then transpose that to B Phrygian. But what seems to happen is you end up with a much darker Pentatonic Sakura that sounds more evil than like funeral.

## Phind Says
Transposing the Pentatonic Sakura to B Phrygian can create a darker sound than expected, as the Phrygian mode is known for its dissonance and dark quality. However, you can still experiment with different chord progressions and harmonies to create a unique blend of French classical music and Gagaku music. As mentioned earlier, Gagaku music is characterized by its use of traditional Japanese instruments such as the hichiriki, ryuteki, and sho, and it has a distinct sound that is based on intonations at odds with the Western chromatic scale. To blend Gagaku music with the Church modes in Western music, you can try to embrace the chromaticism of the Phrygian mode and use the tritone between the II and V chords to create a jarring melodic contour. You can also use the semitone between the tonic and the b2 to create a unique and interesting sound [blog.discmakers.com, 10].

Using French classical instruments to play Gagaku music can also create a unique sound. However, since these instruments have a different timbre and tuning than traditional Japanese instruments, they may need to be adapted to fit the Gagaku music style. For example, you can try using the harpsichord, flute, and horn to play Gagaku melodies, but you may need to transpose or rearrange the melodies to fit the new scale. Similarly, you can use traditional Japanese instruments such as the hichiriki, ryuteki, and sho to play French classical music pieces, but you may need to adapt the instruments to fit the Western scale [2].

It is worth noting that Gagaku music is characterized by the use of traditional Japanese instruments and is based on intonations at odds with the Western chromatic scale. Therefore, blending Gagaku with Church modes in Western music may require a careful consideration of the differences in scales and tuning. However, experimenting with different chord progressions and harmonies can lead to a unique and interesting sound that combines the best of both worlds.


## My Eighth Prompt
Going with the unique sound idea, what are some barriers that might exist for playing Japanese music on Arabic music theory where tones reside between half tones?

## Phind Says
Arabic music theory is based on a musical tuning system that relies on specific interval structures and is characterized by a seven note scale that repeats at the octave. The notes in this structure are not of equal temperament and also determine the tonic and dominant notes. Arab music also has a rich variety of rhythmic patterns, known as awzan or "weight," that are used to accompany metered vocal and instrumental genres, to accent or give them form. Arab music is arranged in modal structures called maqam, which are based on a seven note scale that repeats at the octave. According to Habib Hassan Touma, there are five components to Arabic music, including the Arab tone system, rhythmic-temporal structures, musical instruments, specific social contexts, and an Arab musical mentality [7].

Japanese music, on the other hand, is characterized by its use of pentatonic scales and specific modes. Traditional Japanese music uses a system of modes known as kumi-uta, which are based on specific scales and chord progressions. Japanese traditional music also uses specific instruments such as the koto, shamisen, and shakuhachi to create its unique sound [7].

Therefore, blending Japanese music with Arabic music theory may require a careful consideration of the differences in scales and tuning. The use of a different tuning system in Arabic music theory, where tones reside between half tones, may affect the sound of Japanese melodies and modes. However, experimenting with different chord progressions and harmonies can lead to a unique and interesting sound that combines the best of both worlds. It is also important to note that both Arabic and Japanese music have their own unique sound and style, and combining them may require a significant amount of sampling and modeling to produce a realistic and authentic sound [7].


## My Nineth Prompt
My approach with experimental scales like this, is to take Japanese modes like Pentatonic Sakura in B, and detune the modes down by a quarter tone.

## Phind Says
Detuning Japanese modes like Pentatonic Sakura in B down by a quarter tone could create a unique sound that blends Japanese and Arabic music theory. However, it is important to note that Arabic music theory is characterized by a seven-note scale that relies on specific interval structures and is not based on equal temperament. On the other hand, Japanese music is characterized by its use of pentatonic scales and specific modes. Detuning Japanese modes down by a quarter tone could affect the sound of the modes and may require a significant amount of sampling and modeling to produce a realistic and authentic sound. Additionally, it is important to consider how the detuning would affect the playing technique of the shamisen or other Japanese instruments, as well as how the interface would need to be designed to accommodate the difference between Japanese and Arabic music theory.


## My Prompt
At the moment I mainly do this for electronic music, to get around the fact that there seems to be a derth of 24 TET pianos, except in universities in Finland.

## Phind Says
Based on the search results provided, it seems that detuning Japanese modes like Pentatonic Sakura in B down by a quarter tone may be useful for creating experimental music in electronic music genres. However, it may be challenging to play microtonal scales on a traditional keyboard, as most keyboards are designed for use with the twelve-tone equal temperament system. According to [Source 4], there are few keyboards or controllers that are designed to play microtonal scales, and creating a custom controller can be difficult. However, some musicians have experimented with using tablets and software like Lemur to create their own microtonal controllers.

It is also important to note that creating a digital piano with a 24-tone equal temperament system may be challenging, as most digital pianos are designed to mimic the sound and feel of an acoustic piano. According to [Source 7], digital pianos with 88 weighted keys and hammer action are preferred by students and professionals alike due to their ability to replicate the feel of an acoustic piano. However, some digital pianos offer additional sound options, including simulations of electric pianos and other instruments. Therefore, it may be possible to create a digital piano with a 24-tone equal temperament system, but it would require careful consideration of the sound and feel of the instrument.


## My Prompt
How about a custom controller with a limited set of microtonal sounds? Ex. A special synthesizer that only uses five or six tones, and each tone is one of six tones in a special version Diminished pentatonic Sakura detuned by a quarter tone.

## Phind Says
Creating a custom controller with a limited set of microtonal sounds could be an option for experimenting with microtonal scales. According to [Source 13], the MISUCO app offers an Open Sound Control/MIDI controller with a built-in synth that allows you to explore microtonal tuning in a way that was not available before. The app enables you to translate arbitrary frequencies into MIDI note numbers and pitch values and can also be used as a versatile touchscreen keyboard and controller. With the MISUCO software, you can play with microtonality by tuning each note on an octave in cent steps and blurring the frequency space between the scale to play the frequencies between, like pulling a string of an instrument. If you don't want to use any external equipment and software, the app has a simple but powerful built-in synthesizer. Therefore, using a custom controller with a limited set of microtonal sounds could be an option for experimenting with microtonal scales.


## My Prompt
How would you do a quarter tone variation of Hypophrygian music?

## Phind Says
To create a quarter tone variation of Hypophrygian music, you would need to divide the octave into 24 equal parts using equal temperament [1]. Quarter tones are a pitch halfway between the usual notes of a chromatic scale or an interval about half as wide as a semitone [3]. Thus, quarter tones divide the octave by 50 cents each, and have 24 different pitches. To achieve this, you would have to tune each note in the Hypophrygian mode to one of these 24 pitches [1].

One approach to creating quarter tones would be to use the 24-tone equal temperament (24-TET) system, which is an equal-tempered tuning system that divides the octave into 24 equal steps [3]. In this system, the quarter tone is 50 cents, and is the smallest step. A semitone is made of two steps, and three steps make a three-quarter tone or neutral second, half of a minor third. The 8-TET scale is composed of three-quarter tones [3].

Another approach would be to use just intonation tuning systems. In just intonation, the quarter tone can be represented by the septimal quarter tone, 36:35 (48.77 cents), or by the undecimal quarter tone (i.e. the thirty-third harmonic), 33:32 (53.27 cents), approximately half the semitone of 16:15 or 25:24 [3]. Composer Ben Johnston uses a small "7" as an accidental to indicate a note is lowered 49 cents, or an upside down "7" to indicate a note is raised 49 cents, or a ratio of 36:35. Johnston uses an upward and downward arrow to indicate a note is raised or lowered by a ratio of 33:32, or 53 cents [3].

To apply this knowledge to Hypophrygian music, you would need to tune each note in the mode to one of the 24 pitches in the 24-TET system or use just intonation tuning systems [1] [3]. When you have done this, you will have created a quarter tone variation of Hypophrygian music.
