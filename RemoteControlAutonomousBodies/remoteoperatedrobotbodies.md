## Oh wait that means robots dont have the same issue human bodies do, as you dont haven to put in the software brain directly, but rather remotely operate a shell body stored safely on a localhost server outside its body.

The question seems to touch on the topic of remote operation of robots and how it can be accomplished. Remote operation is necessary in many cases where it is difficult or dangerous for humans to work such as in deep sea or outer space. There are several ways in which remote operation of robots can be achieved, and this depends on the type of robot, its location, and the environment in which it operates. [Source 11]

One way to achieve remote operation is through the use of a remote ROS network. For indoor robots, a local ROS network is sufficient, where all components are networked via a local Wi-Fi router. For outdoor robots, however, the situation becomes more challenging. In this case, a remote ROS network is needed, where components are networked remotely through the cloud. [Source 3]

Another way to enable remote operation is through remote device management of connected robots. Connected robots can be thought of as connected IoT devices on wheels, autonomously navigating in the field they are deployed in. They need to be remotely managed, and typical device management features are required. Remote device management systems will invariably involve an agent which resides on the robot, typically on the host CPU. The agent should provide a flexible handshake with the robot application for all features of remote management. Fleet management, security, adaptivity, analytics, location, scheduling, monitoring, data storage, and log data are some of the functional features that remote device management should provide. Provisioning and authentication, command and control, configuration updates, monitoring and diagnostics, and software updates and upgrades are some of the key functional features that admins should remember for remote management of robots. [Source 5]

The importance of interfacing to middleware cannot be overstated. ROS is a very popular middleware in robotics. ROS1 is and will remain de-facto for a while but ROS2 is also coming up. Both provide various publish and subscribe topics and services for command and control over which the remote management agent needs to interface to the robot’s primary application. There are robots in the field and organizations developing new robots which don’t use ROS. The ability to interface to robots native application is important. ROS provides a bridge feature to handshake between a Non-ROS application and a ROS application. [Source 5]

One issue that may arise when using remote operation is connectivity loss. Connectivity may not be available or possible in areas where industrial robotics and autonomous mobile robots are deployed. For example, AMRs can get deployed in remote sites such as mining fields, where there is no cellular connectivity. Satellite connectivity is costly. Connectivity loss should not result in robot malfunctioning, and its remote management should remain active, but in a different form. It is essential to support capture logs, streaming diagnostics, algorithm data from the field robot, and software updates via USB or local Ethernet LAN as part of remote management. Push captured data on the robot to the management server at a later point. [Source 5]

In conclusion, remote operation of robots can be achieved through various means, including the use of a remote ROS network and remote device management of connected robots. The importance of interfacing to middleware cannot be overstated, and connectivity loss should be catered for to ensure that the robot can still be remotely managed.

## Yes, although I specifically mean input and output are seperate devices, and as long as the black box mechanism and output mechanism remain in tact, it can remote control input systems that are wirelessly connected.

Yes, it is possible to remotely control input systems that are wirelessly connected as long as the black box mechanism and output mechanism remain intact. There are various systems available that can wirelessly control devices such as industrial instruments and home appliances, as shown in [Source 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264916561_WIRELESS_CONTROL_FOR_INDUSTRIAL_INSTRUMENTS_AND_HOME_APPLIENCES_AT_UHF) and [Source 11](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2020/8868602/). These systems use microcontrollers, wireless equipment controllers, and wireless networks to remotely control devices. 

In [Source 11](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2020/8868602/), the system design and implementation phase of a wireless home automation system is discussed in detail. The system has two distinct parts: the wireless control system and the home network system. The smartphone and personal computer are connected wirelessly to the network directly or over the Internet to enable remote control of home appliances as well as communication on updated states of the appliances. The Raspberry Pi microcontroller has the instance of OpenHAB software installed on it and acts as the central server for the system. It also hosts the MQTT server, which is a publisher- and subscriber-based protocol that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other over a wireless network. The Arduino microcontroller communicates with the router via the ESP8266 module. It receives and broadcasts the state of the appliances via the MQTT protocol, where all clients can either subscribe or publish their status. An automated or user-queried action is then taken based on the subscribed device state. 

Similarly, [Source 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264916561_WIRELESS_CONTROL_FOR_INDUSTRIAL_INSTRUMENTS_AND_HOME_APPLIENCES_AT_UHF) describes a microcontroller-based wireless equipment controller that can switch on or switch off devices at a desired time interval set by the user in the transmitter. This system is a combination of a transmitter and a receiver module, where the transmitter is used to send wireless signals and the receiver is used to receive the signals. The receiver is connected to the device that needs to be controlled, and the transmitter is used to send signals to the receiver to control the device. 

In conclusion, there are various systems available that can wirelessly control devices. These systems use microcontrollers, wireless equipment controllers, and wireless networks to remotely control devices. The systems discussed in [Source 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264916561_WIRELESS_CONTROL_FOR_INDUSTRIAL_INSTRUMENTS_AND_HOME_APPLIENCES_AT_UHF) and [Source 11](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2020/8868602/) are examples of such systems. These systems can be used to remotely control input systems that are wirelessly connected, as long as the black box mechanism and output mechanism remain intact.

## An idea I had was having the ones that control brain function and recieving input on a localhost server or shared file system, and having input systems be what acts almost like GPT for real world input data.

It is possible to have the ones that control brain function and receive input on a localhost server or shared file system, and have input systems act almost like GPT for real-world input data. These concepts are related to Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which act as communication mechanisms that use brain signals to control external devices, as explained in [Source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7374399/). Traditional BCI systems have been dependent only on brain signals recorded using Electroencephalography (EEG) and have used a rule-based translation algorithm to generate control commands. However, the recent use of multi-sensor data fusion and machine learning-based translation algorithms has improved the accuracy of such systems. 

In [Source 2](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/realtime/rda/), the remote data access (RDA) interface of the BrainVision Recorder can stream the data over a TCP/IP connection. The ft_realtime_brainampproxy function (part of the realtime module in FieldTrip) reads the EEG data stream from the TCP/IP connection and writes to a FieldTrip buffer. This shows that it is possible to store the data received from a BCI on a remote server or shared file system. 

[Source 12](https://www.emotiv.com/brain-controlled-technology/) explains that EMOTIV's Mental Commands algorithm can recognize trained thoughts that can be assigned to control virtual and real objects just by thinking. This shows that it is possible to use brain control to replace traditional input devices like keyboards and provide new ways for the disabled to engage with their surroundings. 

In conclusion, it is possible to have the ones that control brain function and receive input on a localhost server or shared file system and have input systems act almost like GPT for real-world input data. These concepts are related to BCIs, which use brain signals to control external devices. It is also possible to store the data received from a BCI on a remote server or shared file system. Additionally, it is possible to use brain control to replace traditional input devices like keyboards.

## Which would imply remote wireless brains are possible?

Yes, remote wireless brains are possible. As mentioned in [Source 0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03297), wireless communication technologies play an essential role in data communication for remote-brained robots. This paper presents earlier applications of remote-brained robots, discussion on the advancements in robotic technology towards networked robot systems, and finally, the rise of cloud robots. [Source 4](https://www.reviewgeek.com/23879/wireless-brain-machine-interface-allows-for-remote-control-of-robots-pcs) explains that wireless brain-machine interfaces allow for remote control of robots and PCs. This research comes as countless startups and tech titans including Facebook are vying for a piece of the market. In Facebook’s case, the company announced in April 2017 that it was working on a method that would allow users to type with their minds at 100 words a minute, while more recently it spent an estimated $500 million to $1 billion on neural interface startup CTRL-Labs for its mind-reading wristband.

[Source 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285522011831) describes a self-powered wireless mini-invasive brain probe that can be wirelessly powered and controlled by cellphone audio tones (through piezoelectric effect) with the assistance of AI cellphone video analysis. The probe consists of a biocompatible pedestal integrated with implanting stimulation electrodes connected to embedded magnets and a magnetically coupled custom-designed signal-intensifying resonator integrated with a piezoelectric powered signal modulation circuit. A programmed audio tone functions as the wireless power source, and it can be tele-transmitted remotely from other cellphones with desired neural stimulation protocols. Combined with AI-enabled video monitoring of the epileptic tremor, we show that the probe can relieve the seizure events in the epileptic mice, and the therapeutic effect is confirmed by in-vivo electroencephalography and free-moving scenario. The multi-functionality of versatility, AI-assistance, wireless power transfer, and tele-transmission of the cellphone-interacted brain probe opens the possibility for remote precision neural modulation.

In conclusion, remote wireless brains are possible, as evidenced by the use of wireless brain-machine interfaces to control robots and PCs and the development of a self-powered wireless mini-invasive brain probe that can be wirelessly powered and controlled by cellphone audio tones with the assistance of AI cellphone video analysis.
