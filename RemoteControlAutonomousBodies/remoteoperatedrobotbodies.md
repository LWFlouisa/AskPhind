## Oh wait that means robots dont have the same issue human bodies do, as you dont haven to put in the software brain directly, but rather remotely operate a shell body stored safely on a localhost server outside its body.

The question seems to touch on the topic of remote operation of robots and how it can be accomplished. Remote operation is necessary in many cases where it is difficult or dangerous for humans to work such as in deep sea or outer space. There are several ways in which remote operation of robots can be achieved, and this depends on the type of robot, its location, and the environment in which it operates. [Source 11]

One way to achieve remote operation is through the use of a remote ROS network. For indoor robots, a local ROS network is sufficient, where all components are networked via a local Wi-Fi router. For outdoor robots, however, the situation becomes more challenging. In this case, a remote ROS network is needed, where components are networked remotely through the cloud. [Source 3]

Another way to enable remote operation is through remote device management of connected robots. Connected robots can be thought of as connected IoT devices on wheels, autonomously navigating in the field they are deployed in. They need to be remotely managed, and typical device management features are required. Remote device management systems will invariably involve an agent which resides on the robot, typically on the host CPU. The agent should provide a flexible handshake with the robot application for all features of remote management. Fleet management, security, adaptivity, analytics, location, scheduling, monitoring, data storage, and log data are some of the functional features that remote device management should provide. Provisioning and authentication, command and control, configuration updates, monitoring and diagnostics, and software updates and upgrades are some of the key functional features that admins should remember for remote management of robots.

The importance of interfacing to middleware cannot be overstated. ROS is a very popular middleware in robotics. ROS1 is and will remain de-facto for a while but ROS2 is also coming up. Both provide various publish and subscribe topics and services for command and control over which the remote management agent needs to interface to the robot’s primary application. There are robots in the field and organizations developing new robots which don’t use ROS. The ability to interface to robots native application is important. ROS provides a bridge feature to handshake between a Non-ROS application and a ROS application. [Source 5]

One issue that may arise when using remote operation is connectivity loss. Connectivity may not be available or possible in areas where industrial robotics and autonomous mobile robots are deployed. For example, AMRs can get deployed in remote sites such as mining fields, where there is no cellular connectivity. Satellite connectivity is costly. Connectivity loss should not result in robot malfunctioning, and its remote management should remain active, but in a different form. It is essential to support capture logs, streaming diagnostics, algorithm data from the field robot, and software updates via USB or local Ethernet LAN as part of remote management. Push captured data on the robot to the management server at a later point. [Source 5]

In conclusion, remote operation of robots can be achieved through various means, including the use of a remote ROS network and remote device management of connected robots. The importance of interfacing to middleware cannot be overstated, and connectivity loss should be catered for to ensure that the robot can still be remotely managed.
