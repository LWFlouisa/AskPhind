## Oh wait that means robots dont have the same issue human bodies do, as you dont haven to put in the software brain directly, but rather remotely operate a shell body stored safely on a localhost server outside its body.

The question seems to touch on the topic of remote operation of robots and how it can be accomplished. Remote operation is necessary in many cases where it is difficult or dangerous for humans to work such as in deep sea or outer space. There are several ways in which remote operation of robots can be achieved, and this depends on the type of robot, its location, and the environment in which it operates. [Source 11]

One way to achieve remote operation is through the use of a remote ROS network. For indoor robots, a local ROS network is sufficient, where all components are networked via a local Wi-Fi router. For outdoor robots, however, the situation becomes more challenging. In this case, a remote ROS network is needed, where components are networked remotely through the cloud. [Source 3]

Another way to enable remote operation is through remote device management of connected robots. Connected robots can be thought of as connected IoT devices on wheels, autonomously navigating in the field they are deployed in. They need to be remotely managed, and typical device management features are required. Remote device management systems will invariably involve an agent which resides on the robot, typically on the host CPU. The agent should provide a flexible handshake with the robot application for all features of remote management. Fleet management, security, adaptivity, analytics, location, scheduling, monitoring, data storage, and log data are some of the functional features that remote device management should provide. Provisioning and authentication, command and control, configuration updates, monitoring and diagnostics, and software updates and upgrades are some of the key functional features that admins should remember for remote management of robots. [Source 5]

The importance of interfacing to middleware cannot be overstated. ROS is a very popular middleware in robotics. ROS1 is and will remain de-facto for a while but ROS2 is also coming up. Both provide various publish and subscribe topics and services for command and control over which the remote management agent needs to interface to the robot’s primary application. There are robots in the field and organizations developing new robots which don’t use ROS. The ability to interface to robots native application is important. ROS provides a bridge feature to handshake between a Non-ROS application and a ROS application. [Source 5]

One issue that may arise when using remote operation is connectivity loss. Connectivity may not be available or possible in areas where industrial robotics and autonomous mobile robots are deployed. For example, AMRs can get deployed in remote sites such as mining fields, where there is no cellular connectivity. Satellite connectivity is costly. Connectivity loss should not result in robot malfunctioning, and its remote management should remain active, but in a different form. It is essential to support capture logs, streaming diagnostics, algorithm data from the field robot, and software updates via USB or local Ethernet LAN as part of remote management. Push captured data on the robot to the management server at a later point. [Source 5]

In conclusion, remote operation of robots can be achieved through various means, including the use of a remote ROS network and remote device management of connected robots. The importance of interfacing to middleware cannot be overstated, and connectivity loss should be catered for to ensure that the robot can still be remotely managed.

## Yes, although I specifically mean input and output are seperate devices, and as long as the black box mechanism and output mechanism remain in tact, it can remote control input systems that are wirelessly connected.

Yes, it is possible to remotely control input systems that are wirelessly connected as long as the black box mechanism and output mechanism remain intact. There are various systems available that can wirelessly control devices such as industrial instruments and home appliances, as shown in [Source 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264916561_WIRELESS_CONTROL_FOR_INDUSTRIAL_INSTRUMENTS_AND_HOME_APPLIENCES_AT_UHF) and [Source 11](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2020/8868602/). These systems use microcontrollers, wireless equipment controllers, and wireless networks to remotely control devices. 

In [Source 11](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2020/8868602/), the system design and implementation phase of a wireless home automation system is discussed in detail. The system has two distinct parts: the wireless control system and the home network system. The smartphone and personal computer are connected wirelessly to the network directly or over the Internet to enable remote control of home appliances as well as communication on updated states of the appliances. The Raspberry Pi microcontroller has the instance of OpenHAB software installed on it and acts as the central server for the system. It also hosts the MQTT server, which is a publisher- and subscriber-based protocol that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other over a wireless network. The Arduino microcontroller communicates with the router via the ESP8266 module. It receives and broadcasts the state of the appliances via the MQTT protocol, where all clients can either subscribe or publish their status. An automated or user-queried action is then taken based on the subscribed device state. 

Similarly, [Source 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264916561_WIRELESS_CONTROL_FOR_INDUSTRIAL_INSTRUMENTS_AND_HOME_APPLIENCES_AT_UHF) describes a microcontroller-based wireless equipment controller that can switch on or switch off devices at a desired time interval set by the user in the transmitter. This system is a combination of a transmitter and a receiver module, where the transmitter is used to send wireless signals and the receiver is used to receive the signals. The receiver is connected to the device that needs to be controlled, and the transmitter is used to send signals to the receiver to control the device. 

In conclusion, there are various systems available that can wirelessly control devices. These systems use microcontrollers, wireless equipment controllers, and wireless networks to remotely control devices. The systems discussed in [Source 4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264916561_WIRELESS_CONTROL_FOR_INDUSTRIAL_INSTRUMENTS_AND_HOME_APPLIENCES_AT_UHF) and [Source 11](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2020/8868602/) are examples of such systems. These systems can be used to remotely control input systems that are wirelessly connected, as long as the black box mechanism and output mechanism remain intact.
