## My Prompt
The reason I ask about Marshall Loading, is Marshall has a way of loading small pieces of code over time, rather than have it all be under one bin file. For instance, suppose you have a complete training set in Naive Bayes. The algorithm I chose, there isn't a viable way to do machine unlearning. But with Marshall you can dump one training datapoint over time, and then coelesc them together. And also remove marshall files that give bad data, even if Naive Bayes itself does have any innate ability to do this. Are there ways of going about this use case in XML, to distribute over things like RSS?


## Phind Says
It seems like you want to distribute small pieces of code using XML and RSS. You can achieve this by creating an RSS feed and dynamically updating it with the data you want to distribute. Here's how you can do that:

1. Create an XML file to store your RSS feed. You can follow the RSS format mentioned in [Source 11](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-rss-feeds/) and [Source 12](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/10/best-practices-for-xml-sitemaps-rssatom).

2. Use a programming language to read data from your database and insert it into the appropriate tags in the RSS feed. The steps for this process will vary depending on the programming language you use. The general idea is to:
   - Connect to the database containing the information you want to add to the RSS feed.
   - Fetch the required data (usually the most recent entries).
   - For each item, generate an `<item>` tag, fill in the required tags and content, and generate the `</item>` tag.

   You can find more details on how to achieve this in [Source 14](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-an-rss-feed-for-your-site-from-scratch/).

3. Make your RSS feed discoverable by feed readers. You can do this by:
   - Manually adding items to the XML file each time a new entry is published or the feed should be updated.
   - Sending a `Content-Type: application/xml` header before any other information when using a script to create the RSS feed.
   - Saving the script as an XML file and having your web server software treat it as a scripting file (e.g., `AddType application/x-httpd-php .xml` in `.htaccess` for Apache).

   More details on making your RSS feed discoverable can be found in [Source 14](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-an-rss-feed-for-your-site-from-scratch/).

4. To remove "bad" data from your feed, you can add a filter in your script to exclude certain data points based on specific criteria. This can be achieved by checking the data before inserting it into the RSS feed and only including the data that meets your requirements.

By following these steps, you can create a dynamic RSS feed that distributes small pieces of code and can be updated with new data as needed.


## My Second Prompt
Not a correction, but an addendum. Apparently now you can read RSS documents over IPFS as well.


## Phind Says
Yes, you can read RSS documents over IPFS. With IPFS, you can create and distribute content through a decentralized network. This can be useful for sharing and updating RSS feeds. To read RSS documents over IPFS, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an RSS feed and host it on IPFS. You can use a tool like [Fido2RSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fido2rss) to generate an RSS feed from a FIDO2 token. This feed can be hosted on IPFS, making it accessible to anyone with the IPFS address.

2. Subscribe to the IPFS-hosted RSS feed using an RSS reader. This will allow you to receive updates and new content from the feed.

3. If you want to add or remove content from the feed, you can edit the RSS file hosted on IPFS and update the IPFS content. This will reflect the changes in the RSS feed, allowing you to modify the content dynamically.

An example of a project that uses IPFS to distribute RSS feeds is [Planet](https://changelog.com/news/planet-decentralized-blogs-websites-powered-by-ipfs-ens-MbYG). This project uses IPFS for file storage and the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for discovery and syndication. It acts as a decentralized RSS reader app, allowing you to subscribe to other decentralized sites running on the network.

By using IPFS to host and distribute RSS feeds, you can create a decentralized and dynamic content distribution system.
