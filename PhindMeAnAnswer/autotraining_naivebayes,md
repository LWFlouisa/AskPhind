## My Prompt
I have three seperate sets of code:

~~~xml
<grammar>
  <phrase>
    <gender>An</gender>
    <noun>apple</noun>
    <conjucation>it is</conjucation>
    <verb>eaten</verb>
    <adverb>quickly.</adverb>
  </phrase>
</grammar>
~~~

~~~ruby
# Require and include gem.
require 'rexml/document'
include REXML

# Read in XML document
# xmlfile = File.new("grammar.xml")
xmlfile = File.new("brains.xml")

xmldoc = Document.new(xmlfile)

# Get root elements.
root = xmldoc.root

# Listen to a form of grammar.
xmldoc.elements.each("grammar/phrase") { 
  |e| print e.attributes["context"] + " "
}

# This will output the text of the user introduction.
xmldoc.elements.each("grammar/phrase/gender")      { |e| print e.text + " " }
xmldoc.elements.each("grammar/phrase/noun")        { |e| print e.text + " " }
xmldoc.elements.each("grammar/phrase/adjective")   { |e| print e.text + " " }
xmldoc.elements.each("grammar/phrase/conjunction") { |e| print e.text + " " }
xmldoc.elements.each("grammar/phrase/verb")        { |e| print e.text + " " }
xmldoc.elements.each("grammar/phrase/adverb")      { |e| print e.text       }

~~~

~~~ruby
require "naive_bayes"

a = NaiveBayes.new(:sense, :nonsense)

## Sense
a.train(:sense, "An apple it is eaten quickly.", "word")

## Nonsense
a.train(:nonsense, "quickly. An apple it is eaten", "word")
a.train(:nonsense, "eaten quickly. An apple it is", "word")
a.train(:nonsense, "is eaten quickly. An apple it", "word")

b = "BIANCA: La cabine braun es azeoir pedecise."

result = a.classify(b)

print "That makes #{result[0]}."
~~~

if you were to analyze this without context, what would be your best case for the purpose for this?

## Phind Says
The given code snippets can be divided into three parts:

  * An XML structure representing a grammar with phrases and their respective parts. developer.com
  * A Ruby script that uses the REXML library to parse the XML file and extract the text content of each element in the grammar structure. developer.com, xml.com
  * A Ruby script that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify a given text as either "sense" or "nonsense" based on training data. iro.umontreal.ca

The purpose of this code, without context, seems to be to parse an XML file containing grammar phrases, extract the text content of the phrases, and then use a Naive Bayes classifier to determine whether a given text is sensible or nonsensical based on the extracted grammar structure. The classifier is trained with sample sentences to make this determination.
