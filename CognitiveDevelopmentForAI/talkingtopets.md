## My Prompt
This isn't a programming question strictly, but scientists have theorized that human babies get smarter when you talk to them. Are there any papers that give hints on whether pets like cats and dogs develop more intelligently as we talk to them?

## Phind's Answer
While there is no direct evidence that talking to cats and dogs like humans improves their intelligence, some studies have shown that dogs are sensitive to pet-directed speech (PDS) and that it can engage their attention ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Another study found that dogs can process speech similar to humans, favoring different brain hemispheres for processing different aspects of human speech sciencenews.org.

In terms of cognitive development, pet ownership has been linked to slower cognitive decline in older adults sciencedaily.com. However, this study focused on dogs and cats as companions, not specifically on the effects of talking to them like humans.

Although the provided sources do not directly address the effects of talking to cats and dogs like humans on their cognitive development, they do suggest that dogs are sensitive to human speech and can process it in a manner similar to humans. Further research is needed to determine the specific effects of talking to pets like humans on their cognitive development.

## My Second Prompt
If you were to thus develop an AI based around a smart dog's or cat's intelligence, designed also to cognitively developer, would talking to them as they develop help them improve their intelligence? A lot of scientists talk about building AI based around the human brain, but my thoughts is that we'll probably more likely have intervals between levels of AGI.

## Phind's Answer
Developing an AI based on a smart dog's or cat's intelligence is an interesting idea. While the provided sources do not directly address the effects of talking to pets like humans on their cognitive development, they do suggest that pets can have positive effects on human cognition and mental health [Source 1](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220223210035.htm), [Source 4](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/health/pets-brain-health-study-wellness/index.html), [Source 6](https://www.pastemagazine.com/science/neuroscience/on-the-mind-how-pets-help-our-brains).

If AI were to be developed based on pet intelligence, it might be possible that interacting with the AI in a way similar to how we talk to pets could have positive effects on human cognition. However, this idea would require further research and experimentation to determine its feasibility and potential benefits.

Regarding the development of AI, it is true that there might be intervals between levels of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) before reaching a fully autonomous and intelligent system. Building AI based on the human brain or pet intelligence could be a step towards achieving AGI, but the specific approach and its effectiveness would depend on the research and advancements in the field.
